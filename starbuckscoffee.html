                <p>Starbucks began in 1971 as a single store in Seattle, Washington, founded by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker.</p>
                <p>Originally it focused on selling coffee beans and equipment, the company’s direction shifted when Howard Schultz joined in 1982. Inspired by Italian espresso bars, Schultz envisioned Starbucks as a place where people could gather over handcrafted beverages. He acquired the company in 1987 and began its transformation into the world’s most recognizable coffeehouse brand.</p>

            <p>From that point forward, Starbucks expanded rapidly, growing from a regional chain into a global presence with tens of thousands of stores worldwide. The company is now known not only for its coffee but also for its role in shaping café culture, digital ordering, and customer experience.</p>
